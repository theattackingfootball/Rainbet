  <h1>Rainbet Exposed: The Most Dangerous Bookie on Football Twitter</h1>
  <p class="meta">2025-09-26 09:00:00</p>
  <article>
  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s Saturday afternoon, and your football timeline is flooded with posts: glossy screenshots of winning bet slips showing thousands staked and tens of thousands returned. Always the same logo stamped in the corner — <strong>Rainbet</strong>. Always the same tag in the bio — <strong>@Rainbet</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first glance, it looks like ordinary fans sharing their lucky wins. The reality is far more sinister. Those slips are <strong>fabricated marketing material</strong>. The people posting them never placed the bets. They are paid to pretend — part of a coordinated, parasitic advertising campaign by an offshore bookmaker with no accountability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who and What Rainbet Really Is</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet is not licensed in the UK, Ireland, or anywhere in the EU. It operates through <strong>RBGaming N.V.</strong>, a company incorporated in Curaçao, but its gambling licence comes from <strong>Anjouan</strong>, a small island in the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anjouan relaunched its gambling licensing regime in 2023, promising quick, cheap approvals with minimal oversight. That’s exactly why operators like Rainbet flock there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>A UK <a href="https://www.attackingfootball.com/footballs-grip-on-the-gambling-industry/" data-type="post" data-id="14810">Gambling</a> Commission (UKGC) licence costs hundreds of thousands of pounds, requires segregation of player funds, independent audits, mandatory responsible gambling tools, and proof of financial reserves.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>An Anjouan licence costs a few thousand dollars. There is no requirement for audits, no evidence that player funds are protected, no independent dispute resolution, and no meaningful consumer protection.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you deposit money with Rainbet, you have <strong>no guarantee you’ll ever see it again</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Red Flags in the Terms and Conditions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buried deep in Rainbet’s terms are clauses that no serious regulator would ever approve:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Restricted countries</strong>: Residents of the US, UK, Germany, Spain, France, and others are banned. Yet Rainbet still markets aggressively to those regions. If you’re from one of them and you win, Rainbet can refuse to pay by pointing to the fine print.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>VPN trap</strong>: Use a VPN to sign up or play? Your winnings can be voided.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Withdrawal hurdles</strong>: Rainbet reserves the right to demand ID, bank statements, selfies, even video calls before processing withdrawals. They can freeze funds indefinitely if they’re not “satisfied.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Promotional scam</strong>: Winnings from welcome bonuses or affiliate codes are capped at <strong>$50 maximum withdrawable</strong>. If you hit a huge win on a promo, the rest is simply confiscated.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Three-day dispute window</strong>: You have just 72 hours to challenge how a bet was settled. After that, your right to appeal is gone.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Liability cap</strong>: Even if Rainbet is at fault, their maximum liability is <strong>€500</strong> — no matter how much you’ve lost.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most grotesque clause is in their <strong>self-exclusion policy</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“By initiating self-exclusion, you agree not to create another account, deposit or attempt to deposit funds, place wagers on Rainbet, and acknowledge that this is a voluntary action for which Rainbet holds no liability for any losses during the exclusion period.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Translated: If you’re addicted and relapse, Rainbet keeps your money and accepts no responsibility. In regulated markets like the UK or Malta, this is precisely the kind of failure that results in multi-million-pound fines. Offshore, it’s business as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Human Cost</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve spoken to people who lost everything to Rainbet. Life savings gone. Some of them were suicidal. Not just once, but over and over again. And nearly every one of them had tried to stop. They had self-excluded. They had asked for help. Rainbet ignored them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One man told me he had self-excluded months earlier, but managed to open a new account using the same device, the same crypto wallet, and the same IP address. Nothing flagged. No checks. Just another deposit page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“I lost £7,000 in a single hit. I went straight to live support and told them I had another account that was self-excluded because of gambling harm. They said, ‘Message the managers.’ That’s all. So I did. I sent a full complaint, told them they were breaking the rules. They ignored it.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three days later, he lost another £100,000. His entire life savings. Gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“I messaged the CEO. Told him I was suicidal. He said he’d speak to support. Then nothing. He ghosted me. I sent more than 30 emails. Begged them to respond. They blocked me from live chat so I couldn’t even reach anyone. They left me to die.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not exaggeration. That’s the reality for people trapped in these cycles, looking for a way out, only to be pulled back in by a site that couldn’t care less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second person I spoke to found Rainbet through endless Instagram ads. Every second or third reel on his feed was Rainbet — flashy wins, easy deposits, no questions asked. Signing up took seconds. No ID. No KYC. Not even email verification. Just pick a username, drop in crypto, and start losing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“Even after I self-excluded, they let me back in straight away. No block. No delay. Every time I tried to stop, they made it easy to start again. I emailed management. Nothing. No reply. No help.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said the platform used psychological triggers to keep him hooked. Small bonuses were sent out at the same time each day. Just enough to keep him coming back. Just enough to lose it all again. He took out high-interest loans. He’s now drowning in debt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“It wasn’t just the money. It was the weight of it. The shame. The loneliness. I cut myself off from friends and family. I was in a constant loop of chasing losses and hating myself. It pushed me to some horrible places. I told them I had a problem. They did nothing.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t a bug in their system. It’s the business model. Keep vulnerable players depositing until there’s nothing left. Then block them, ignore them, and move on to the next wallet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the UK, this would be illegal. Operators are fined millions for letting self-excluded players back in. They’re forced to refund losses. But Rainbet is based offshore in Anjouan, a tiny island that offers licences with zero enforcement. No fines. No accountability. No protections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not just irresponsible. It’s dangerous. And it’s happening to people every day. This is where the influencer money comes from. The lives being wrecked on the other side of the screen. These are just two stories. There are undoubtedly hundreds if not thousands more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Fake Bet Slip Scam</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet’s rise hasn’t come through traditional advertising. Google, Facebook, and Twitter/X only allow gambling ads from licensed operators in respected jurisdictions. Rainbet doesn’t qualify.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it invented a workaround: <strong>pay influencers directly to post fake winning slips as if they were their own bets</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Smaller football accounts (under 20k followers) are offered <strong>$50 per post</strong>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Larger accounts (50k+ followers) can earn <strong>$100–$250 per post</strong>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Massive accounts can earn much more.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Rainbet approaches users via <strong>Telegram (@rainbetshin)</strong>, <strong>Discord (rainbetshin)</strong>, or email (<strong><a>sarah@rainbet.com</a></strong>).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>They send <strong>fabricated slips</strong> showing thousands staked and huge payouts.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Influencers must add <strong>@Rainbet</strong> to their bio to look like genuine customers.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is <strong>paid advertising disguised as personal behaviour</strong>. It’s deliberately deceptive and illegal under multiple jurisdictions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>ASA rules (UK)</strong>: All paid promos must be disclosed as ads.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>EU UCPD</strong>: Hidden marketing is banned.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>FTC rules (US)</strong>: Paid endorsements must be “clear and conspicuous.”</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet doesn’t care. It relies on secrecy, plausible deniability, and the hunger of young football accounts for quick cash.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Football Twitter Is the Perfect Hunting Ground</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Football Twitter is a goldmine for operators like Rainbet. It’s filled with young men, many under 25, who are deeply invested in football and prone to impulsive behaviour. Basically, at that age, most men have too much money, take too much risk, and are, well, too impulsive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every fake slip normalises <strong>high-stakes gambling</strong>. Every retweet makes reckless betting look ordinary. And every click funnels vulnerable fans into a bookmaker where winnings can be frozen and losses are limitless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why it’s predatory. It doesn’t just exploit regulation gaps — it exploits human psychology and community trust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Influencers Have Said to Me</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I reached out to influencers who had promoted Rainbet, I was met with a wide range of responses. Some admitted they shared the fake bet slips despite feeling it was unethical, citing financial pressures and personal circumstances. Others were more candid, telling me their followers “knew it was fake” and that they were simply “getting the bag.” Whilst other accounts said that the money would really help grow their platform, which does make sense in an environment where gambling and sports are so intrinsically linked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, a few chose to disengage entirely, unfollowing me after I asked questions. Pathetic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the agreed anonymity of this article, I will not attribute specific comments to individuals or organisations, but I appreciate those who confirmed the reality of the arrangement: the bet slips were fabricated, distributed to them over Discord, and they were paid to post them. They also confirmed Rainbet never required these posts to be marked as advertisements. Some influencers took it upon themselves to do so. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Several influencers also disclosed the amounts they were paid for these posts, with figures ranging from $50 to $250. However, from speaking with others and observing activity on Twitter, it is clear that some individuals are being paid considerably more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some influencers told me they believed including “#ad” would make it clear the slips were not real and reduce the risk of encouraging others to gamble. But whether labelled or not, the act of sharing them still promotes a company that operates outside regulated frameworks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This article is not intended to direct anger toward influencers</strong>. They are a symptom rather than the cause. When a cash-rich operator offers what can be life-changing money, it takes a strong character to refuse—especially when the “job” appears to be nothing more than posting a tweet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet the impact of such posts should not be underestimated. Gambling addiction is serious, and promoting an unregulated operator risks drawing followers into harmful behaviour. Being an influencer carries responsibility, and encouraging people to sign up with Rainbet ultimately means encouraging them to gamble with a company that lacks proper oversight. You are responsible for what you share. You should research the companies that you partner with. You should be held accountable for your actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>BUT, please direct your attention towards Rainbet, not the influencers. They are the ones driving this strategy and enabling these practices. If you feel compelled to take action, the most effective step you can take is to share this article so that others who may not yet know about Rainbet can be informed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Really Owns Rainbet?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On paper, Rainbet is operated by <strong>RBGaming N.V.</strong>, incorporated in Curaçao, with a licence from Anjouan. But who actually owns it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s almost impossible to know. Curaçao and Anjouan are both <strong>secrecy-friendly jurisdictions</strong>. Operators can register through corporate service providers and use “nominee directors” to sign paperwork. The real beneficial owners remain hidden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Curaçao technically requires disclosure of “Ultimate Beneficial Owners” (UBOs), but the information is private.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Anjouan doesn’t even pretend to offer transparency.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ghost Executives</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet lists <strong>John Evans</strong> as CEO and co-founder. His LinkedIn shows no history apart from Rainbet. He has no presence in gambling industry records, no other corporate affiliations, and no track record. His name only appears in Rainbet’s own PR. It’s impossible to verify whether he is a genuine executive, a front figure, or simply a constructed persona.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet’s <strong>Chief Marketing Officer</strong> is a “Sean R.” — but no footprint exists for him either. For such a senior role, this is highly unusual and suggests deliberate opacity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only figure with a documented history is <strong>Guilherme Fideles</strong>, current Chief Operations Officer. But his CV tells its own story:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>BoglaGold</strong> (shut down in 2019 after legal action from RuneScape’s developer Jagex).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>MaisBet – Sportsbook</strong> (no online presence, short-lived).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>MMO Games LP</strong> (officially dissolved in 2020).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tokenbets</strong> (grey-market operator).</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every company he’s worked for is either <strong>defunct or legally grey</strong>. It’s a pattern: recycled operators from the edges of legality, not credible industry leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Simple Comparison: UKGC vs Rainbet</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:table -->
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>UKGC/MGA Licensed Operator</th><th>Rainbet (Anjouan Licence)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Segregated player funds</td><td>✅ Yes</td><td>❌ No</td></tr><tr><td>Independent audits</td><td>✅ Regular</td><td>❌ None</td></tr><tr><td>Self-exclusion enforcement</td><td>✅ Mandatory (e.g. GAMSTOP)</td><td>❌ Player liability if relapse</td></tr><tr><td>Dispute resolution</td><td>✅ Independent ADR required</td><td>❌ None</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency of owners</td><td>✅ Public records</td><td>❌ Hidden behind shells</td></tr><tr><td>Advertising rules</td><td>✅ Strict, disclosed</td><td>❌ Fake slips, undisclosed ads</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer compensation scheme</td><td>✅ Exists</td><td>❌ None</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<!-- /wp:table -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Rainbet, you gamble without a safety net. If they freeze your money, void your winnings, or vanish overnight, you are simply left with nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Matters Globally</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t just an Irish issue. Rainbet operates in markets where it is technically illegal — including the UK, Germany, and Spain. It advertises through football influencers despite being banned from running ads on mainstream platforms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result is a <strong>globalised gambling loophole</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Offshore licences (Anjouan, Curaçao) provide cover.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Platforms like Twitter/X look the other way.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Influencers sell fake wins for pocket money.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Real people lose savings and lives.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until regulators and platforms coordinate to close this gap, offshore operators will keep preying on football fans worldwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rainbet Outreach</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funnily enough, during the process of researching and writing this article, Rainbet reached out to Attacking Football’s Twitter account, offering a partnership. As part of my due diligence, I contacted them to confirm the details of what such a partnership would entail, but despite following up, they did not respond. It seems likely they had seen my posts referencing the company. My chances of internet sleuthing had ended before they began.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rainbet Declines to Comment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of my reporting, I contacted Rainbet directly, including outreach to the Rainbet marketing team, the account "RainbetJohn," and other representatives, with a detailed set of questions covering licensing, consumer protection, responsible gambling, marketing practices, payment methods, and leadership transparency. Despite offering them the opportunity to respond and provide their perspective ahead of publication, no comment was received by the requested deadline. Here were the questions I put to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear Rainbet Marketing Team,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am preparing an article examining the rise of offshore operators such as Rainbet and would like to give you the opportunity to comment directly. The piece will cover your licensing, consumer protections, and marketing practices, as well as comparisons with regulated markets such as those under the UK Gambling Commission and Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to ensure accuracy and balance, I would appreciate your response to the following questions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Licensing &amp; Consumer Protection</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Why did Rainbet choose an Anjouan licence rather than a regulator like the UKGC or MGA, which provide stronger consumer protections?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. What independent audits or fund protection mechanisms does Rainbet have in place to guarantee player balances?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. How do you respond to criticism that players from restricted jurisdictions (UK, Ireland, Germany, etc.) can still sign up and deposit despite your own Terms &amp; Conditions?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Responsible Gambling &amp; Self-Exclusion</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. Your Terms shift liability for losses during self-exclusion onto the player — how is this consistent with responsible gambling standards?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. If a self-excluded player manages to open a new account and gamble, does Rainbet refund those losses, or does the burden always stay on the customer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. What specific responsible gambling tools (deposit limits, time-outs, affordability checks) are available on Rainbet?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marketing Practices</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7. Multiple social media users claim they were offered payments to share “bet slips” they never actually placed, without disclosure that these were adverts. Is this part of Rainbet’s marketing strategy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>8. Why does Rainbet rely on influencers rather than transparent, regulated advertising campaigns?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>9. What safeguards are in place to ensure minors or vulnerable people aren’t targeted by this marketing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Payments &amp; Transparency</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>10. Why does Rainbet primarily rely on crypto deposits and gift cards via third-party platforms like Kinguin instead of conventional payment processors?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>11. How do you verify the source of funds, given the AML (anti–money laundering) risks inherent in crypto and gift cards?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>12. Who are the “ultimate beneficial owners” of RBGaming N.V. — and why are they not disclosed publicly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leadership &amp; Accountability</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>13. Can you confirm whether John Evans, Sean R., and other named executives are real individuals in operational roles, and provide verifiable details of their experience?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>14. Why has Rainbet’s leadership not been more visible in regulated gambling contexts, beyond isolated appearances like Mike Mersereau at SBC Summit 2025?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would be grateful if you could provide comment by Wednesday, 18th September 2025, so your perspective can be included in the final article.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Rainbet a Scam?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Search “Rainbet scam” and you will find the same story repeated: players questioning whether this bookmaker is real, or just a sophisticated con.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet’s growth has been fuelled by <strong>fake bet slips</strong>. Glossy screenshots show massive wins that were never placed. These are not genuine customers celebrating their luck; they are influencers paid to pretend. Most posts do not carry an <strong>“#ad” disclosure</strong>, making them illegal adverts in the UK, EU, and US. But as they're not posting them themselves and people are masquarading this as their own bet, it is grey, and gets around regulations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problems go deeper than misleading marketing. Rainbet’s <strong>self-exclusion rules</strong> are some of the most dangerous in the industry. Instead of blocking vulnerable players, they put the entire burden on the gambler. If you relapse during a self-exclusion period, the terms make clear it is your fault, and Rainbet keeps your money. In regulated markets like the UK, this would result in million-pound fines. Offshore, it is just another Tuesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The payment process raises more red flags. Rainbet does not use mainstream processors or banks. Instead, players are often pushed towards <strong>Kinguin gift card vouchers or cryptocurrency deposits</strong>. These methods are designed to bypass oversight, making it nearly impossible to trace or recover lost funds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":22188,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src=""" alt="" class="wp-image-22188"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm not joking either, one of the main ways to purchase credit for your Rainbet account is through Gift Cards on Kinguin. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":22189,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src=""" alt="" class="wp-image-22189"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most alarming signs of Rainbet’s operation is this reliance on Kinguin gift cards as a way to load credit. Rather than using mainstream payment methods like Visa or PayPal, players are directed to purchase vouchers through a marketplace best known for reselling video game keys. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not a quirky alternative; it is a deliberate tactic to avoid regulatory oversight and consumer protection. Once a voucher is redeemed, the money cannot be traced or refunded, leaving players with no recourse if funds are frozen. It also creates a dangerous psychological distance, turning real money into “tokens” that feel easier to gamble and lose. For any bookmaker claiming legitimacy, relying on Kinguin gift cards is a glaring red flag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Taken together, the signs are unmistakable. Rainbet may look slick on social media, but when you peel back the surface, the mechanics scream scam: fabricated wins, undisclosed influencer ads, predatory terms, and deliberately opaque payment channels. If you are asking whether Rainbet is safe, the answer is simple. <strong>No.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Bottom Line</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet presents itself as a slick, modern bookmaker and casino. In truth, it’s a case study in everything wrong with offshore gambling:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Fake bet slips</strong> promoted by paid shills.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Predatory terms</strong> designed to void winnings and keep deposits.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>A self-exclusion policy that punishes the vulnerable.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Opaque leadership and shell companies.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Zero accountability when harm occurs.</strong></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depositing money with Rainbet is a gamble in itself. The wins you see on Twitter aren’t real — but the losses are, and they’re borne by ordinary fans manipulated into thinking they can beat the system.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don't Expect Rainbet to Disappear</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rainbet isn't going anywhere. They’ve got money to burn and no one holding them back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://arazu.io/t3_1ih6g51/?timeframe=all&amp;category=hot">Adin Ross</a> signed a deal reportedly worth $100 million and showed off a $256,000 ‘win’ on his very first stream, all while streaming from Florida, where Rainbet is technically banned under its own terms of service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If they can afford to pay one influencer nine figures, imagine how much money people are losing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why they pay streamers, this is why they pay influencers. This is why the ads never stop. Not because players win, but because most of them don’t. Gambling is a vicious addiction. Unlike drugs or alcohol, you won’t see the signs. There’s no smell, no slurred speech, no obvious high. It’s silent. Hidden behind screens and bank statements. But it wrecks lives just the same. You probably know someone who's struggling, you just don’t know it yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So if you see the flashy clips or the big “wins” and feel tempted, just remember where that money’s really coming from.</p>
