Dear Manager,

I’m writing from Attacking Football regarding our article, “Rainbet Exposed: The Most Dangerous Bookie on Football Twitter,” published on 26 September 2025. As a matter of fairness, I’m offering Rainbet a right of reply for inclusion in any updates and in follow-on coverage.

Since publication, our social media accounts have experienced an abrupt surge in suspicious activity (large volumes of bot-like follows and likes with abnormal view/engagement ratios). I raised this in your live chat with an agent identified as “Abby”.

Please provide an on-the-record response to the following by 17:00 (UK/Irish time) tomorrow:

1. Allegations & Licensing

Rainbet’s position on our reporting regarding licensing, payment methods and marketing practices.

Confirmation of the corporate entity(ies) operating Rainbet, jurisdiction(s) of incorporation, and active gambling licence(s).


2. Marketing & Influencer Practices

Whether Rainbet or any affiliate/agency funds, incentivises, or supplies fabricated bet-slip imagery for promotional use.

Standard compliance controls you apply to affiliates and paid promoters (vetting, disclosure, geo-compliance, self-exclusion obligations).


3. Botting / Coordinated Activity

Whether Rainbet, its staff, contractors, affiliates, or marketing partners have initiated, directed, or otherwise caused automated follows/likes directed at our accounts since publication.

If not, what steps will Rainbet take to assist in identifying any third-party responsible (e.g., auditing affiliate activity, reviewing campaign logs)?

Confirmation that Rainbet has issued a cease directive to all affiliates/partners prohibiting any harassment, brigading or inauthentic engagement against critics.


4. Data, Safety & Escalation

Name and contact details for a senior point of contact for press and escalations.

Confirmation that you will preserve relevant logs and records (marketing briefs, affiliate dashboards, campaign IDs, payment records for social activity) from 24 Sept 2025 to present pending any platform or regulatory inquiries.

If you believe any element of our reporting is inaccurate, please specify precisely what you contest and provide supporting documentation so we can review promptly.

Unless you state otherwise, I will treat your reply as on the record and attributable to Rainbet. If you prefer an attributable spokesperson name and title, please include it in your response.

Thank you in advance. I look forward to your response within the timeframe above.

Kind regards,

Paddy Keogh
